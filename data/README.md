## CSV Format (Simplified & Clean! ‚ú®)

Your `sspork-holders.csv` file should use this simple, clean format:

```csv
address,usdc_reward
0x742d35Cc6635C0532925a3b8D710432D8c14C3C1,500.50
0x8ba1f109551bD432803012645Hac136c,1001.00
0x1234567890123456789012345678901234567890,750.25
```

### Column Descriptions

- **`address`** - Ethereum wallet address (required)
- **`usdc_reward`** - USDC reward amount (required)

**That's it! Clean and simple.** üéØ

---

## Alternative: Full Format (Optional)

If you want to keep records of sSPORK holdings for audit purposes:

```csv
address,sspork_amount,usdc_reward
0x742d35Cc6635C0532925a3b8D710432D8c14C3C1,1000,500.50
0x8ba1f109551bD432803012645Hac136c,2000,1001.00
0x1234567890123456789012345678901234567890,1500,750.25
```

*Note: sSPORK amount is only for your records - not used by the smart contract.*

### Data Requirements

‚úÖ **Valid Ethereum addresses** - Each address must be a valid 42-character hex string  
‚úÖ **Positive USDC amounts** - All reward amounts must be greater than 0  
‚úÖ **No duplicates** - Each address should appear only once  
‚úÖ **Proper format** - CSV headers must match exactly  

## Processing Your Data

1. **Add your CSV file** to this directory as `sspork-holders.csv`

2. **Run the processing script:**
   ```bash
   npm run process-csv data/sspork-holders.csv
   ```

   *This uses the simplified format by default. For full format with sSPORK records:*
   ```bash
   npm run process-csv-full data/sspork-holders.csv
   ```

3. **Generated files:**
   - `src/data/merkle-proofs.json` - Frontend eligibility data
   - `deployment-info.json` - Contract deployment configuration

## Example Data

Here's a sample CSV with test addresses:

```csv
address,sspork_amount,usdc_reward
0x742d35Cc6635C0532925a3b8D710432D8c14C3C1,1000,500.50
0x8ba1f109551bD432803012645Hac136c,2000,1001.00
0x1234567890123456789012345678901234567890,1500,750.25
0xd8dA6BF26964aF9D7eEd9e03E53415D37aA96045,3000,1500.00
0x95cED938F7991cd0dFcb48F0a06a40FA1aF46EBC,500,250.75
```

## Data Security

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important Notes:**
- CSV files with real holder data are excluded from git by default
- The `.gitignore` prevents accidental commits of sensitive data
- Keep holder data secure and only share with authorized personnel
- Generated Merkle proofs are safe to commit (they don't expose raw data)

## Validation

The processing script will validate:
- Address format and checksums
- Positive reward amounts  
- No duplicate addresses
- Proper CSV structure
- Data consistency

Any errors will be reported during processing with specific row numbers.

## Support

If you encounter issues with your CSV data:
1. Check the format matches the example exactly
2. Verify all addresses are valid Ethereum addresses
3. Ensure no negative or zero reward amounts
4. Remove any duplicate entries
