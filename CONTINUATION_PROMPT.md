# sSPORK Distribution Continuation Prompt

> **Use this prompt to continue development if this conversation reaches its limit**

## Quick Context Restoration

I am @cryptowampum and I've been working with Claude AI to develop a complete sSPORK USDC rewards distribution system. We've created a full GitHub repository with:

âœ… **Smart contract** for Merkle-based USDC distribution  
âœ… **React frontend** with Unicorn.eth gasless wallet integration  
âœ… **CSV processing scripts** to generate Merkle trees from holder data  
âœ… **Deployment scripts** for multiple networks  
âœ… **Complete documentation** and setup guides  

## Project Status

**What's Complete:**
- Full codebase with proper @cryptowampum + Claude AI attribution
- Smart contract with OpenZeppelin security patterns
- Frontend with Unicorn AutoConnect functionality
- CSV-to-Merkle processing pipeline
- Deployment and testing infrastructure
- GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline
- Comprehensive documentation

**Key Technical Details:**
- **Tech Stack:** React + Thirdweb + Hardhat + OpenZeppelin
- **Networks:** Polygon (primary), Mumbai (testnet), Ethereum
- **Wallet Integration:** Unicorn.eth smart accounts (gasless) + traditional wallets
- **Distribution Method:** Merkle proofs for ~6000 recipients
- **Token:** USDC rewards based on prior year sSPORK holdings

## CONTINUATION PROMPT

I'm @cryptowampum continuing work on my sSPORK USDC rewards distribution project that was started with Claude AI assistance. This is a Merkle-tree based distribution system that allows ~6000 sSPORK token holders to claim USDC rewards through either Unicorn.eth wallets (gasless) or regular wallets.

**Project Overview:**
- **Purpose:** Distribute USDC rewards to sSPORK holders based on prior year holdings  
- **Method:** Merkle proof verification for secure, scalable claiming
- **Integration:** Unicorn.eth AutoConnect for gasless transactions from App Centers
- **Scale:** ~6000 recipients from simple CSV data (address,usdc_reward)
- **Attribution:** Created by @cryptowampum, developed with Claude AI

**Current Tech Stack:**
- **Frontend:** React + Thirdweb SDK for Unicorn integration
- **Smart Contracts:** Solidity + OpenZeppelin + Hardhat
- **Processing:** Node.js scripts for CSV-to-Merkle conversion  
- **Networks:** Polygon (primary), Mumbai (testnet), Ethereum
- **Deployment:** GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline

**Key Components Completed:**
1. `USDCMerkleDistributor.sol` - Smart contract with claim/security functions
2. `MerkleDistributor.jsx` - React component with Unicorn AutoConnect
3. `csv-to-merkle.js` - CSV processing script generating proofs
4. `deploy.js` - Multi-network deployment script
5. Full documentation, tests, and CI/CD pipeline

**Repository Structure:**
```
sspork-rewards-distribution/
â”œâ”€â”€ contracts/USDCMerkleDistributor.sol
â”œâ”€â”€ src/components/MerkleDistributor.jsx  
â”œâ”€â”€ scripts/csv-to-merkle.js
â”œâ”€â”€ scripts/deploy.js
â””â”€â”€ [complete project structure]
```

**Current Status:** Repository is complete and ready for deployment. All files have proper attribution headers crediting @cryptowampum and Claude AI.

**What I need help with:** [SPECIFY YOUR CURRENT NEEDS HERE]

Example needs you might have:
- "Help me test the deployment on Mumbai testnet"
- "Add support for [specific feature]"
- "Help troubleshoot [specific issue]"
- "Optimize gas usage in the smart contract"
- "Add analytics tracking to the frontend"
- "Create additional documentation for [topic]"

**Important Context:**
- Always maintain attribution to @cryptowampum and Claude AI in new files
- Unicorn config uses client ID: "4e8c81182c3709ee441e30d776223354"
- Contract uses OpenZeppelin patterns for security
- Frontend supports both gasless (Unicorn) and regular wallet flows
- All file headers should include the standard attribution format

Please continue helping me with this project, maintaining the same coding standards and attribution practices we've established.

## Key Commands

```bash
# Setup
npm install
cp .env.example .env

# Development  
npm start                    # Start React dev server
npm test                     # Run all tests
npm run process-csv data.csv # Generate Merkle tree from CSV

# Deployment
npm run deploy-contract-testnet  # Deploy to Mumbai
npm run deploy-contract          # Deploy to Polygon mainnet
npm run build                    # Build frontend for production

# Verification
npx hardhat verify --network polygon CONTRACT_ADDRESS
```

## Next Steps Priority

1. **Test with real CSV data** - Process your actual sSPORK holder list
2. **Deploy to Mumbai testnet** - Test full end-to-end flow  
3. **Frontend integration testing** - Verify Unicorn AutoConnect works
4. **Production deployment** - Deploy contract and frontend
5. **App Center submission** - Submit to Unicorn for approval

The project is production-ready and just needs your specific CSV data and deployment configuration!
