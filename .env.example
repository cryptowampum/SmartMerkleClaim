#    - Fund it with enough ETH/MATIC for deployment
#    - Never use your main wallet for deployment
#
# 2. Get free RPC endpoints:
#    - Polygon: https://polygon-rpc.com (no signup required)
#    - Mumbai: https://rpc-mumbai.matic.today (no signup required)  
#    - Ethereum: Sign up at Infura.io or Alchemy.com
#
# 3. Get free API keys:
#    - Polygonscan: https://polygonscan.com/apis
#    - Etherscan: https://etherscan.io/apis
#
# 4. Test deployment on Mumbai first:
#    - npm run deploy-contract-testnet
#    - Get free Mumbai MATIC from: https://faucet.polygon.technology/
#
# 5. Deploy to mainnet:
#    - npm run deploy-contract
#    - Ensure you have enough MATIC for gas fees
